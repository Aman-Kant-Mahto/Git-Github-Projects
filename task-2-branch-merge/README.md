# 🌿 Task 2: Branching & Merging in Git

## 📌 Introduction
Branches allow you to develop new features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.  
This task demonstrates how to create a **new branch**, make changes, and safely merge them back into the main branch.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Create a new branch called `feature1`.
2. Make changes in the branch and commit them.
3. Switch back to the `main` branch.
4. Merge the `feature1` branch without conflicts.
