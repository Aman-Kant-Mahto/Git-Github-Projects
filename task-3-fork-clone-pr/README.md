# 🔀 Task 3: Fork, Clone & Pull Request

## 📌 Introduction
Open-source collaboration often starts with forking a repository.  
In this task, we explore how to **fork a GitHub repository**, clone it locally, make changes, and submit a **Pull Request** to the original project.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Fork an existing repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repository locally.
3. Make the required changes and commit them.
4. Push changes to the fork.
5. Open a Pull Request to merge your changes into the original repo.
